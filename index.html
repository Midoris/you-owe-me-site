                <strong>YouOweMe</strong> is built for real life: ongoing balances, partial repayments, shared expenses, and the awkward conversations that come with them.
                Track who owes whom, keep everything clear, and use Money Conversations to generate ready-to-send texts for real situations: follow-up, ask for loan, and repayment update — in a tone that fits your relationship.
                When you need something formal, generate professional PDF statements from your records.

                <p>
                  The hardest part about money is often not the math - it is the message.
                  Money Conversations gives you three ready-to-send message types based on real balances and history:
                  Follow-Up, Ask for Loan, and Repayment Update.
                </p>
                <p class="lt-note" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        Choose a tone (friendly, polite, or firm), adjust details if needed, and keep full control.
